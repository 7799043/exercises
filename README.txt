#It's a plan:

01   Count duplicate characters in the string. Output can be a HashMap<String, Integer> or whatever container you like) 
02   Find the 1st non-repeated character in the string 
03   Reverse letters in the string
04   Check if the string contains only digits
05   Count the number of vowels and consonants in the string
06   Count the occurrences of the character in a string. The method has 2 params character and word
07   Generate all permutations for the string
08   Check if the word is a palindrome
09   Remove duplicate characters from the string
10  Remove a given character from the string
11  Find the characters with the most appearances
12  Find the longest common prefix for an array of strings

UPDATE:
#The basic plan is done. Now I am starting to automation testing.
